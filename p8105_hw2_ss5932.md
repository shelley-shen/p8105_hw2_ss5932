## Problem 1: Mr. Trash Wheel

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",   
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation", 
    skip = 1, 
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018,
         total = as.numeric(total)) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation", 
    skip = 1, 
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation and change month number to name by
creating separate month tibble.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12, 
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # ... with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trash Wheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trash wheel collects that trash and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, including some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 14 columns and 344 rows in
our final dataset. Additional data sheets include month and
precipitation data for each year between 2014-2019.

The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33inches.

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8 balls.

## Problem 2: NYC Transit

*Part 1: Read and clean the NYC Transit data.*

``` r
nyc_transit_df = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = "TRUE", "NO" = "FALSE"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
view(nyc_transit_df)
```

The NYC Transit dataset contains a variety of variables pertaining to
the NYC transit system. After reading in the csv file, I cleaned the
data by first using the clean\_names function from the janitor package
to make all variable names in the same format with lowercase letters and
snake case. Then, I used the select command to retain only the variables
of interest and omit all other extraneous variables. The following
variables are those of interest: line, station, name, station latitude
and longitude, routes served, entry, entrance type, vending, and ADA
compliance. Finally, I converted the “entry” variable from the original
character vector into a logical vector by using the recode function
embedded in the mutate function. The resulting dataset contains 1868
rows and 19 columns. The data is relatively tidy since each variable and
entry has its own column and row, respectively.
